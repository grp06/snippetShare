snippetShare
============

A Chome Extension + A Meteor App

Snippet Share is a Chrome Extension that is like an enhanced copy+paste. When you highlight text and right click it, you get an extra menu item, "Save Snippet". When you click "Save Snippet", you 'tag' the text you highlighted and it's saved in my web app.
